# Decentral homeautomation
Decentral homeautomation deals with autonomous smart devices (agents) for controlling technical equipment at your home. 
It is creating a kind of perfect butler, who helps anybody, particularly elder and handicaped people, 
with their daily tasks at home. 
I started here to learn using GitHub first. Content will follow later, after testing the latest versions with my students.

# Using GitHub
I decided to use Git and GitHub because of the filter effect on uploaded software. 
So my students or any other interested programmer may improve (hopefully) the software 
and I can check the changes before they go to the repository.
Knowing my own weakness with quick and dirty programming I created at once a second branch and named it {developer} 
to start with content there. 
I know, that with Git it would not be necessary, but it is easier for me to publish some code 
which may cause criticism when there is an implicit promise to check/improve it 
before it is published in the master repository.

# Current development tools and targets
At present I use the Arduino library environment for targets Arduino Due and development boards 
for the WiFi-SoCs ESP8266 and ESP32 (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32). 
For the software development I use Eclipse/Sloeber (http://eclipse.baeyens.it/) on Ubuntu (and sometimes also on Windows). 
One of my students created a bootable USB-Stick with Linux MINT and Sloeber, 
which will be a give-away for students joining the microprocessor laboratory at the University of 
Applied Sciences and Arts in Hannover/Germany. 
My hope is, that these students will have fun with programming and do that also at home.
