# Source code APPs and libraries
At present we do not have a final concept for the structure of the repository with Android software. As far as the modules are similar to the modules at Arduino libraries, we will use the same folder structure and naming.

How the source code may be integrated in Android Studio is described in the [ReadMe.md](https://github.com/RobertPatzke/homeautomation/blob/developer/apps/SocManNet/examplesAndroid/ReadMe.md) located in the folder with [examples](https://github.com/RobertPatzke/homeautomation/tree/developer/apps/SocManNet/examplesAndroid).

At this level of the repository are the libraries located. It is not a library structure as Java experts would use. Here simply are Java source files (.java) sorted into folders naming their purpose. There may be cross references between the files inside a folder. But we will avoid cross references between files in different folders (I hope it works).
