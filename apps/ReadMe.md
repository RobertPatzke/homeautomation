# Source code APPs and libraries
At present we do not have a final concept for the structure of the repository with Android software. As far as the modules are similar to the modules at Arduino libraries, we will use the same folder structure and naming.

How the source code may be integrated in Android Studio is described in the ReadMe.md located in the folder with examples.
