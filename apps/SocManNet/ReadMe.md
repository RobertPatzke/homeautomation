# Social Manufacturing Network in Java
This library is the counterpart to the [SocManNet library in C/C++](https://github.com/RobertPatzke/homeautomation/tree/developer/libraries/SocManNet) for Arduino and other microcontroller boards.

There is a project (with low priority) to integrate the C/C++ files via NDK in Android APPs, instead of the Java files presented now.
