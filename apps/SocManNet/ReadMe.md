# Social Manufacturing Network in Java
This library is the counterpart to the [SocManNet library in C/C++](https://github.com/RobertPatzke/homeautomation/tree/developer/libraries/SocManNet) for Arduino and other microcontroller boards.

Class FollowMultiDev is a little bit different to its counterpart in C/C++. The resources of smartphones and tablets ar so big compared to microcontrollers, that we decided to use more classes (and lists) here.

There is a project (with low priority) to integrate the C/C++ files via NDK in Android APPs, instead of the Java files presented now.

The folder resources contains universal value resources (at this time just colors) for the Androis development.
