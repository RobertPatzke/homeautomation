Needed content for AndroidManifest.xml

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS"/>


source folder / package name:  stcheckall

library folder (parallel):     systemtools
libraries (java files):        BatteryTool.java, ScreenTool.java


Extra resources:
in ...res/values:              colors.xml   from ../../resources

Note:
Since Android 5 there is another security level for settings, i.e. an app has to ask the user at runtime for permission.
In this example, it is not cared for it, instead the Targed Sdk Version was set to Android 4.0 (like the Min Sdk Version).
